Synopsis

Sequences to Sequences Recurrent Neural Networks have many uses, one of them is translation. We are going to implement a simple 
model for translating from English to French.
 
Code example

You will find 4 programs. The main one is "dlnd_language_translation.ipynb". The aim of "dlnd_language_translation.html" is to help 
you to visualize the code, right in your browser. On the other hand, "helper.py" and "problem_unittests.py" are auxiliar programs 
needed to run the translator. We assume that all the scripts have to be in the same directory, otherwise, you will have to 
indicate the path.

Motivation

This project is part of the wonderful Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree, of Udacity. You just can download it and running, but in that case you would not learn more. It is and educational tool, and the more of you would be in it more useful will became.

Installation

I order tu run it, you will need python 3.5 in your computer, with the Google Tensorflow library for Machine Learning installed. Probably, in python 2.7 this programs will not work, since they have not implementened and test in this version. If you have a GPU Cudda Compatible, you can just run locally the program. In other case, you have to take into account that this kind of Neural Networls are extremely low to run and train on a CPU. I strongly recommend use a Cloud Computing service, as AWS, or the amazing platform Floyhub.

Tests

Just run the code "dlnd_language_translation.ipynb" in a Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, with all the dependencies installed. In order to
keep the training time short, we have chosen a small language corpus, if you want to improve the model just use a larger dataset.

Contributors

This little proect would have be impossible without the advices and support of a lot classmate. I would like to thank specially to koby2000 and antonvangoethemi. Without your patience and support and would not have been able to do it. Thanks guys!
